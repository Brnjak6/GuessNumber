# GuessNumber

A simple javascript functionality created with power of DOM manipulation. 
Following the Jonas Schmedtmann's course I've been eager to reconstruct the 
same idea from his lessons to personaly desgined and most importantly functional game.

Goal of the game is simple, all you have to do is insert a number and guess a secret number hiding under question mark.
If you fail to guess in 10 tries you lose. Once you guess the number, you win. The game also keeps track of your high score.

This is a simple development and just a beginning of many more project to come.
